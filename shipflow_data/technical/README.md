# Technical Documentation

## Purpose

`shipflow_data/technical/` is the internal code-proximate documentation layer for ShipFlow. It tells agents which durable subsystem doc to read, which files are owned by that subsystem, which invariants must survive edits, and which checks prove the change.

This layer complements the existing docs:

- `shipflow_data/technical/architecture.md` stays the global system view.
- `shipflow_data/technical/context.md` stays the compact operational map.
- `shipflow_data/technical/guidelines.md` stays the general engineering doctrine.
- `shipflow_data/technical/external-platforms/` stores global external provider notes used by the Freshness Gate.
- `shipflow_data/workflow/specs/*.md` stay chantier contracts and run history.
- `shipflow_data/technical/*.md` documents durable subsystem behavior near the code.

## Read Order

1. Open `shipflow_data/technical/code-docs-map.md` and match the changed path.
2. Open the primary technical doc for that subsystem.
3. Open secondary docs only when the map says the change crosses a boundary.
4. After a code-changing wave, produce a `Documentation Update Plan` from the map.
5. Update impacted docs sequentially unless a ready spec assigns disjoint files to separate executors.

| `external-platforms/gum.md` | Charmbracelet Gum commands, install sources, TUI output/exit behavior, prompt cancellation, and Bash menu validation |

## Non-Coverage

The layer does not create one doc per file. Small legacy files such as menu frontend variants, historical archives, and standalone test fixtures are covered through the closest subsystem doc or through an explicit Reader note when a change proves they need a dedicated doc.

## Validation

Run the checks listed in `code-docs-map.md` for the changed paths. At minimum, technical-doc changes should pass:

```bash
rg -n "Maintenance Rule|Validation|Owned files|Entrypoints" shipflow_data/technical templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md
python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py shipflow_data/technical templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md
```

## Maintenance Rule

Update this index when a technical doc is added, renamed, removed, or when a major code area gains an explicit non-coverage reason. Keep this file as an index; put subsystem details in the subsystem docs.
